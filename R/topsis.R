#' TOPSIS Method for Multi-Criteria Decision Making
#'
#' @description
#' Implements the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)
#' to rank alternatives based on multiple criteria. The function normalizes the decision matrix using Min-Max method,
#' applies weights, and computes relative closeness to the ideal solution.
#'
#' @param X A numeric matrix or data frame where rows represent alternatives and columns represent criteria.
#' @param w A numeric vector of weights for each criterion. Must be non-negative and sum to 1.
#'          If not provided, equal weights are used.
#' @param index A character vector indicating the direction of each indicator:
#'              Use `"+"` for positive indicators (higher is better),
#'              `"-"` for negative indicators (lower is better).
#'              If `index = NULL` (default), all indicators are treated as `"+"`.
#'
#' @return A named numeric vector of relative closeness scores (in [0, 1]) for each alternative.
#'         Higher values indicate better alternatives.
#'         Names are taken from \code{rownames(X)} or default to "Sample1", "Sample2", etc.
#'
#' @details
#' The TOPSIS method ranks alternatives by:
#' \enumerate{
#'   \item Normalizing the decision matrix using Min-Max normalization.
#'   \item Applying weights to form a weighted normalized matrix.
#'   \item Identifying positive and negative ideal solutions based on indicator directions.
#'   \item Computing Euclidean distances to ideal solutions.
#'   \item Calculating relative closeness as \code{S0 / (S0 + Sstar)}, where \code{S0}
#'   is the distance to the negative ideal and \code{Sstar} is the distance to the positive ideal.
#' }
#' This implementation supports both positive and negative indicators via the \code{index} parameter.
