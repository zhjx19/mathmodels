\title{Read and Combine National Bureau of Statistics XLS Files}
\usage{
read_nbs(paths)
}
\arguments{
\item{paths}{A character vector containing the file paths to the XLS files.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing the combined data with an additional column \code{indicator} representing
the original indicator names and a \code{region} column with simplified region names.
}
\description{
This function reads multiple XLS files downloaded from the National Bureau of Statistics of China
website (\url{http://www.stats.gov.cn}) without requiring renaming. It extracts the variable name
from the "indicator: XXX" text in cell A1 of each file, skips the first 3 rows of headers, reads
the first 31 rows of data, and combines the data into a single data frame by stacking vertically
based on the indicator names. It also simplifies region names by removing suffixes such as "city",
"province", "autonomous region", "clan", or "Uyghur".

paths = c("file1.xls", "file2.xls")
data = read_nbs(paths)
