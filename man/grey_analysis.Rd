\usage{
grey_corr(ref, cmp, rho = 0.5, w = NULL)

grey_corr_topsis(X, w, index = NULL, rho = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{ref}{Numeric vector, the reference sequence for \code{grey_corr}.}

\item{cmp}{Numeric matrix or data frame, the comparison sequences for \code{grey_corr}.}

\item{rho}{Numeric scalar, the distinguishing coefficient (default = 0.5).}

\item{w}{Numeric vector, weights for weighted correlation (default = equal weights).}

\item{X}{Numeric matrix or data frame, the decision matrix for \code{grey_corr_topsis}.}

\item{index}{Character vector indicating indicator direction:
Use \code{"+"} for positive indicators (higher is better),
\code{"-"} for negative indicators (lower is better),
and \code{NA} for already rescaled indicators (no rescaling will be applied).
If \code{index = NULL} (default), all indicators are treated as \code{NA},
meaning no rescaling is performed.}
}
\value{
\describe{
\item{grey_corr}{Returns a numeric vector of grey correlation degrees for each comparison sequence.}
\item{grey_corr_topsis}{Returns a numeric vector of relative closeness (grey correlation degrees).}
}
}
\description{
A collection of functions for performing grey relational analysis, including
calculation of grey correlation degree and evaluation based on grey correlation.
These functions are designed for decision-making and data analysis by measuring
the relational degree between sequences.
}
\details{
These functions implement grey relational analysis for evaluating relationships
between sequences or decision alternatives:
\describe{
\item{grey_corr}{Computes the grey correlation degree between a reference sequence (\code{ref})
and comparison sequences (\code{cmp}) using the distinguishing coefficient (\code{rho})
and optional weights (\code{w}).}
\item{grey_corr_topsis}{Evaluates a decision matrix (\code{X}) by normalizing it,
applying weights (\code{w}), computing grey correlation with the ideal sequence.
Direction of indicators can be specified via \code{index}.}
}
}
\examples{
# Grey correlation degree
ref = 1:3
cmp = data.frame(x1 = c(1, 2, 4), x2 = c(2, 3, 5))
grey_corr(ref, cmp, rho = 0.5)

# Grey correlation evaluation#'
w = c(0.4, 0.6)
idx = c("+", "-")
grey_corr_topsis(cmp, w, idx, rho = 0.5)
