\title{CRITIC Weight Method}
\usage{
critic_weight(X, index = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric data frame or matrix where rows represent samples (observations)
and columns represent indicators (variables).}

\item{index}{A character vector indicating the direction of each indicator.
Use \code{"+"} for positive indicators (higher is better),
\code{"-"} for negative indicators (lower is better),
and \code{NA} for already normalized indicators (no rescaling will be applied).

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{         If `index = NULL` (default), all indicators are treated as `NA`,
         meaning no normalization or rescaling is performed.
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{w}{Numeric vector of weights for each indicator.}

\item{s}{Numeric vector of scores for each sample (row), scaled by 100.}#'
}
\description{
Computes objective weights of indicators and scores of samples using the CRITIC method.
The method considers both the variance (contrast intensity) and correlation
(conflict among indicators) to determine indicator importance.

\examples{
# Example: Using CRITIC method on a simple dataset
X = data.frame(
  x1 = c(3, 5, 2, 7),
  x2 = c(10, 20, 15, 25)
)
index = c("+", "-")
critic_weight(X, index)
}
