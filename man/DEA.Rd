\description{
Calculates standard and super-efficiency DEA and SBM models (CCR, BCC, and slacks-based),
including efficiency score, slacks, lambdas, targets, returns, and references,
with support for undesirable outputs.
}
\details{
This function provides a simplified interface for computing efficiency scores using radial Data
Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models (Charnes et al., 1978; Banker et al., 1984) and Slacks-Based
Measure (SBM) models (Tone, 2001) via the \pkg{deaR} package. It supports both standard and
super-efficiency models under constant (CRS) or variable (VRS) returns to scale, with optional
handling of undesirable outputs. The package includes four functions: \code{basic_DEA},
\code{super_DEA}, \code{basic_SBM}, and \code{super_SBM}, each tailored to specific DEA or SBM
variants.
\itemize{
\item \strong{Model Types}:
\itemize{
\item \code{basic_DEA}: Implements standard radial DEA models, including CCR (CRS) and BCC (VRS),
optimizing radial efficiency measures (input contraction or output expansion).
\item \code{super_DEA}: Implements super-efficiency radial DEA, excluding the evaluated DMU from
the reference set to allow efficiency scores beyond 1 (radial, output-oriented) or below 1
(radial, input-oriented) for efficient DMUs (Andersen & Petersen, 1993).
\item \code{basic_SBM}: Implements standard SBM, optimizing input and output slacks directly for
a non-radial efficiency measure.
\item \code{super_SBM}: Implements super-efficiency SBM, combining SBM with super-efficiency
properties, excluding the evaluated DMU from the reference set.
}
\item \strong{Orientation}:
\itemize{
\item Input-oriented (\code{"io"}): Minimizes inputs while maintaining output levels. Efficiency
scores are in \eqn{(0, 1]}{(0, 1]} (\eqn{\theta \leq 1}{theta <= 1} for radial models,
\eqn{\rho}{rho} or \eqn{\delta \leq 1}{delta <= 1} for SBM models).
\item Output-oriented (\code{"oo"}): Maximizes outputs for given inputs. Efficiency scores are in
\eqn{(0, 1]}{(0, 1]}. Radial models output \eqn{\eta \geq 1}{eta >= 1}, which is converted
to \eqn{1/\eta}{1/eta}; SBM models output \eqn{1/\rho^*}{1/rho*} or
\eqn{1/\delta}{1/delta} directly.
}
\item \strong{Undesirable Outputs}:
\itemize{
\item Supported in \code{basic_DEA}, \code{super_DEA}, and \code{basic_SBM} using directional
distance functions (DDF) with direction vector \eqn{(g_y, -g_b)}{(g_y, -g_b)} to increase
desirable outputs and decrease undesirable outputs (FÃ¤re & Grosskopf, 2004).
\item For \code{super_SBM}, undesirable outputs are supported by adapting the SBM super-efficiency
model with DDF, ensuring undesirable outputs are minimized appropriately.
}
\item \strong{NA Values in Super-Efficiency Models}:
\itemize{
\item Super-efficiency models (\code{super_DEA}, \code{super_SBM}) may return \code{NA} for
efficient DMUs due to infeasible linear programming solutions, particularly under VRS
(Andersen & Petersen, 1993). This occurs when the reference set, excluding the evaluated
DMU, cannot form a feasible production possibility set.
\item Users can handle \code{NA} values externally, as described in the package vignette. Common
approaches include replacing \code{NA} with standard efficiency scores (from
\code{basic_DEA} or \code{basic_SBM}) or excluding DMUs with \code{NA} values from further
analysis.
}
\item \strong{Returns to Scale (RTS)}:
\itemize{
\item CRS (\code{"crs"}): Assumes constant returns to scale, suitable for long-run analysis where
scale effects are absent.
\item VRS (\code{"vrs"}): Assumes variable returns to scale, allowing increasing (\code{"irs"}) or
decreasing (\code{"drs"}) returns, determined by the sum of intensity variables
(\eqn{\lambda}{lambda}).
}
\item \strong{Outputs}:
\itemize{
\item \code{efficiencies}: A named numeric vector of efficiency scores, standardized to
\eqn{(0, 1]}{(0, 1]} for both input- and output-oriented models.
\item \code{slacks}: A data frame or matrix of input and output slacks, including undesirable
outputs, indicating excess inputs or output shortfalls.
\item \code{lambdas}: A matrix or data frame of intensity variables (\eqn{\lambda}{lambda}),
showing the contribution of reference DMUs to the efficiency frontier (self-excluded in
super-efficiency models).
\item \code{targets}: A data frame or matrix of efficient projection points for inputs and outputs,
adjusted for undesirable outputs in DDF models.
\item \code{returns}: A character vector indicating RTS status (\code{"crs"}, \code{"irs"},
\code{"drs"}) for each DMU.
\item \code{references}: A matrix or data frame listing reference DMUs (peers) contributing to the
efficiency frontier (\eqn{\lambda > 0}{lambda > 0}).
}
}

The package uses \pkg{deaR} for robust computation, handling zero values internally and ensuring
compatibility with input/output specifications. Efficiency scores are standardized to
\eqn{(0, 1]}{(0, 1]} for consistency across models and orientations. For detailed \code{NA}
handling strategies, refer to the package vignette.
