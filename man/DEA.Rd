Subsequent columns are input/output variables.}

indicating input variables.}

\item{outputs}{A numeric vector of column indices or a character vector of column names
indicating (desirable) output variables.}

\item{ud_outputs}{Optional. A numeric vector of denoting the position of undesirable outputs in the outputs. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{orientation}{Character string. Model orientation: \code{"io"} for input-oriented (default),
or \code{"oo"} for output-oriented.}

\item{rts}{Character string. Returns to scale assumption: \code{"vrs"} for variable returns to
scale (default), or \code{"crs"} for constant returns to scale.}

\value{
A list containing six elements:
\item{efficiencies}{A numeric vector of efficiency scores for each DMU.}

\item{targets}{A data frame or matrix containing the efficient target values for inputs and outputs (including undesirable outputs) for each DMU.}
\item{returns}{A character vector indicating the returns-to-scale (RTS) status of each DMU, such as "crs" (constant), "vrs" (variable), "irs" (increasing), or "drs" (decreasing).}

\description{
Calculates standard and super-efficiency DEA and SBM models (CCR, BCC, and slacks-based),
including efficiency score, slacks, lambdas, targets, returns, and references,
with support for undesirable outputs.
}
\details{
This function provides a simplified interface for computing efficiency scores using radial Data
Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models (Charnes et al., 1978; Banker et al., 1984) and Slacks-Based
Measure (SBM) models (Tone, 2001) via the \code{deaR} package. It supports both standard and
super-efficiency models under constant (CRS) or variable (VRS) returns to scale, with optional
handling of undesirable outputs. The package includes four functions: \code{basic_DEA}, \code{super_DEA},
\code{basic_SBM}, and \code{super_SBM}, each tailored to specific DEA or SBM variants.
\itemize{
\item \strong{Model Types}:
\itemize{
\item \code{basic_DEA}: Implements standard radial DEA models, including CCR (CRS) and BCC (VRS),
optimizing radial efficiency measures (input contraction or output expansion).
\item \code{super_DEA}: Implements super-efficiency radial DEA, excluding the evaluated DMU from the
reference set to allow efficiency scores beyond 1 (radial, output-oriented) or below 1
(radial, input-oriented) for efficient DMUs (Andersen & Petersen, 1993).
\item \code{basic_SBM}: Implements standard SBM, optimizing input and output slacks directly for a
non-radial efficiency measure.
\item \code{super_SBM}: Implements super-efficiency SBM, combining SBM with super-efficiency properties,
excluding the evaluated DMU from the reference set.
}
\item \strong{Orientation}:
\itemize{
\item Input-oriented (\code{"io"}): Minimizes inputs while maintaining output levels. Efficiency scores
are in (0, 1] ($\theta \leq 1$ for radial models, $\rho$ or $\delta \leq 1$ for SBM models).
\item Output-oriented (\code{"oo"}): Maximizes outputs for given inputs. Efficiency scores are in
(0, 1]. Radial models output $\eta \geq 1$, which is converted to $1/\eta$; SBM models output $1/\rho^*$ or
$1/\delta$ directly.
}
\item \strong{Undesirable Outputs}:
\itemize{
\item Supported in \code{basic_DEA}, \code{super_DEA}, and \code{basic_SBM} using directional distance functions
(DDF) with direction vector (g_y, -g_b) to increase desirable outputs and decrease undesirable
outputs (FÃ¤re & Grosskopf, 2004).
\item For \code{super_SBM}, undesirable outputs are supported by adapting the SBM super-efficiency model
with DDF, ensuring undesirable outputs are minimized appropriately.
}
\item \strong{NA Values in Super-Efficiency Models}:
\itemize{
\item Super-efficiency models (\code{super_DEA}, \code{super_SBM}) may return NA for efficient DMUs due to
infeasible linear programming solutions, particularly under VRS (Andersen & Petersen, 1993).
This occurs when the reference set, excluding the evaluated DMU, cannot form a feasible
production possibility set.
\item Users can handle NA values externally, as described in the package vignette. Common approaches
include replacing NA with standard efficiency scores (from \code{basic_DEA} or \code{basic_SBM}) or
excluding DMUs with NA values from further analysis.
}
\item \strong{Returns to Scale (RTS)}:
\itemize{
\item CRS (\code{"crs"}): Assumes constant returns to scale, suitable for long-run analysis where scale
effects are absent.
\item VRS (\code{"vrs"}): Assumes variable returns to scale, allowing increasing ("irs") or decreasing
("drs") returns, determined by the sum of intensity variables ($\lambda$).
