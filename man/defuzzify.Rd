\title{Defuzzification Methods for Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation}
\usage{
defuzzify(mu, scores, method = "weighted_average")
}
\arguments{
\item{mu}{Numeric vector, membership degrees for evaluation levels, in \link{0, 1}.}

\item{scores}{Numeric vector, scores corresponding to each evaluation level (e.g., c(100, 80, 60, 40) for "Excellent", "Good", "Fair", "Poor").}

\item{method}{Character, defuzzification method: "weighted_average", "max_membership", "centroid".}
}
\value{
Numeric, defuzzified output value.
}
\description{
Implements defuzzification methods for fuzzy evaluation vectors, including weighted average and maximum membership methods.
}
\examples{
# Example: Defuzzify fuzzy evaluation vectors for three schemes
mu = c(0.318, 0.351, 0.203, 0.128)
scores = c(30, 60, 75, 90)  # Scores for "Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Excellent"
defuzzify(mu, scores, method = "weighted_average")
defuzzify(mu, scores, method = "max_membership")
defuzzify(mu, scores, method = "centroid")
