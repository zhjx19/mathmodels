\title{Combine Subjective and Objective Weights}
\usage{
combine_weights(w_subj, w_obj, type = "linear", alpha = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{w_subj}{Numeric vector of subjective weights.}

\item{w_obj}{Numeric vector of objective weights.}

\item{type}{Character string specifying the combination method: "linear", "multiplicative", "game", or "game_linear".}

\item{alpha}{Numeric value between 0 and 1, used only for the linear method to weight subjective weights. Defaults to 0.5.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of combined weights, normalized to sum to 1.
}
\description{
Combines subjective and objective weights using linear, multiplicative, or game theory-based methods (geometric mean or linear system).
}
\details{
The function supports four methods:
\itemize{
\item Linear: Combines weights as alpha * w_subj + (1 - alpha) * w_obj.
\item Multiplicative: Combines weights as w_subj * w_obj, requiring positive weights.
\item Game: Uses the geometric mean (sqrt(w_subj * w_obj)) to balance weights.
\item Game_linear: Uses a game-theoretic approach by solving a linear system based on the cross-product of weights.
}
}
\examples{
w_subj = c(0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1)
w_obj = c(0.25, 0.2, 0.3, 0.25)
combine_weights(w_subj, w_obj, type = "linear", alpha = 0.6)
combine_weights(w_subj, w_obj, type = "multiplicative")
combine_weights(w_subj, w_obj, type = "game")
combine_weights(w_subj, w_obj, type = "game_linear")
