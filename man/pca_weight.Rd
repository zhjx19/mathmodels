\title{PCA-Based Weighting Method}
\usage{
pca_weight(X, index = NULL, nfs = NULL, varimax = TRUE, method = "abs")
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric data frame or matrix where rows represent samples and
columns represent indicators.}

\item{index}{A character vector indicating the direction of each indicator.
Use \code{"+"} for positive indicators (higher is better),
\code{"-"} for negative indicators (lower is better),
and \code{NA} for already standardized indicators (no standardization will be applied).

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{         If `index = NULL` (default), all indicators are treated as `NA`,
         meaning no standardization is performed.
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}}

\item{nfs}{Number of principal components to use; by default, all are used.}

\item{method}{Weighting Method, "abs" (default, |a_{ji}|) or "squared" (a_{ji}^2)}

\item{varvarimax}{Whether to perform Varimax rotation, default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{w}{Numeric vector of normalized weights for each indicator.}

\item{s}{Numeric vector of scores for each sample.}

\item{lambda}{Eigenvalues of principal components (explained variance).}

\item{varP}{Proportion of variance explained by selected PCs.}
}
\description{
Computes indicator weights using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
The method extracts principal components and uses their variance contribution
to derive objective weights for indicators. Optionally handles positive/negative
directions of indicators, and supports pre-standardized data.

# Example: Using PCA to compute indicator weights
ind = c("+","+","-","-")
pca_weight(iris[1:10, 1:4], ind, nfs = 2)
